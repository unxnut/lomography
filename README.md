This project leads to the development of a lomography filter. Given an image, apply the lomography filter to it and save the
output. The learning objectives in the project include: ability to use a trackbar to modify some parameter of a filter and the use
of callback to apply the filter function. In addition, the project will demonstrate the use of a lookup table (LUT) to improve the
performance of filters.

Historically, lomography filter is used to modify a photograph to improve its aesthetics. It is used in modern applications such
as Instagram to improve the quality of a picture to make it more pleasing. It is named after the Soviet-era cameras produced
by Leningradskoye Optiko-Mekhanicheskoye Obyedinenie (LOMO). *Lomography* is claimed by Lomographische AG as a
commercial trademark but has become a *genericized trademark*. A number of photo editor apps include a *lomo filter*.

This project involves creating two separate filters for lomography. You will develop a simple GUI using two separate trackbars
to change the parameters of those filters. The filters will be applied to an image supplied on the command line. Your program
will provide the following two filters:
1. An effect to manipulate one color channel.
2. A vignette effect by applying a dark halo to the image.
